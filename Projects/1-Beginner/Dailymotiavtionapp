# Dailymotivation

**Tier:** 1-Beginner

Everyone has days when they need a little boost of motivation.
The Daily Motivation App displays inspiring quotes to encourage positivity and productivity.
This project helps beginners practice working with DOM manipulation, event handling, and optional API fetching.

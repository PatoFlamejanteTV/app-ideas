# Habit Tracker App

**Tier:** 1-Beginner

Habit trackers are powerful tools for personal development, helping users build and maintain positive routines. In this app, you'll create a simple habit tracker that allows users to log daily habits, view streaks, and receive reminders. This project is great for understanding state management, data persistence, and basic UI interactions.

The design is up to you—get creative with colors, icons, and layouts! You might draw inspiration from popular habit-tracking apps on your phone to understand core functionality and user experience.

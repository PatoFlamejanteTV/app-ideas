# Light/Dark Mode Toggle App

## Tier: 1-Beginner

### Description
Build a simple web application that allows users to switch between **Light Mode** and **Dark Mode**.  
The user’s theme preference should be **saved locally**, so the next time they open the app, it remembers their choice.

This project will help you learn about DOM manipulation, local storage, and CSS variable theming.

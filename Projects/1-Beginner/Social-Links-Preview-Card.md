# 🌐 Social Links Preview

**Tier:** 1-Beginner

A simple and interactive **Social Links Preview Card** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
This project lets users view and edit their personal profile — including name, location, and occupation — while storing the changes in local storage for persistence.

## 💡 Purpose

It’s perfect for beginners looking to practice **HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript** interaction without frameworks.

# Auto-yo

**Tier**: 1-Beginner 

Yo was a social mobile application for iOS, Android, and formerly also Windows Phone. 
Initially, the application's only function was to send the user's friends the word "yo" as a text and audio notification. 
auto-yo allows the user to sebd a "yo" message to the app, and later recieve a random "yo" notification from the app at a random time.

This challange is a very simple one - it helps the developer to set up a development environment in a language of their choice and actually write and
run a code that does something simple. It's a slightly more complicated and interesting version of "Hello, world!".

## User Stories
-   [ ] User can type in "yo" and after a random amount of seconds (up to 60 seconds), they will recieve a "yo" message back.
-   [ ] User types in something other than "yo" the program will immediately respond with "You can only say "Yo""

## Bonus features 
-   [ ] User can configure how long it takes until the app replies back with a "yo".

# QR Code Generator App

## 1. Objective

A QR Code Generator is a utility application that allows users to create a QR code from a piece of text, typically a URL. QR codes are widely used to quickly share information with smartphone users.

This project will teach you how to work with external libraries or APIs, handle user input, and generate and display images dynamically.

## 2. User Stories

-   [ ] User can see an input field to enter text or a URL.
-   [ ] User can click a "Generate" button to create the QR code.
-   [ ] Once the button is clicked, the app displays the generated QR code image on the screen.
-   [ ] User can see an error message if the input field is empty when they click "Generate".
-   [ ] The generated QR code should be scannable with a standard QR code reader.

## 3. Bonus Features

-   [ ] Add a button that allows the user to download the generated QR code image as a PNG or JPG file.
-   [ ] Allow the user to customize the QR code's color and background color.
-   [ ] Provide options for different QR code sizes (e.g., Small, Medium, Large).
-   [ ] Add a "Clear" button that removes the current QR code image and clears the input field.
-   [ ] Implement a real-time generation feature where the QR code updates as the user types in the input field.
